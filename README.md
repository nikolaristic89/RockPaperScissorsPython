Rock, Paper, Scissors 

## Introduction

Welcome to the ultimate Rock, Paper, Scissors experience! 
This repository contains a Python-based interactive game where players can compete against a computer or watch a game between two computer players.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Generated with Python 3.10.6
- Should work with Python 3.6 or higher

### Steps

Step 1:
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
git clone https://github.com/nikolaristic89/RockPaperScissorsPython.git
   
Step 2: 
Open Terminal or Command Prompt
Windows: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
macOS/Linux: Open Terminal

Step 3: 
Navigate to Your Project Directory
Use the cd (change directory) command to navigate to the directory where your Python files (main.py, game.py, players.py, userinterface.py) are located. 
For example:
cd path/to/your/project
Replace path/to/your/project with the actual path to the folder containing your Python files.

Step 3: Run the Game
Once you're in the correct directory, you can start the game by running main.py with Python. Type the following command:
python main.py
Or if you're using Python 3 specifically you might need to use:
python3 main.py
This command tells Python to execute the code in main.py, which is the entry point to your game.

Step 4: 
Play the Game
After running the command, your game should start, and you'll see the welcome message and instructions in your terminal. 
Follow the prompts to play the game.

## Additional Notes
Python Installation: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can check this by running python --version or python3 --version in your terminal. If Python is not installed, you will need to download and install it from the official Python website.

File Organization: Make sure all the related Python files are in the same directory and that the directory paths in your import statements are correct relative to the location from which you're running main.py.

Permissions: In some cases, especially on Linux or macOS, you might need to make main.py executable by running chmod +x main.py in the terminal.
